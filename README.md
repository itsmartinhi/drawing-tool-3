# Drawing Tool

## How to use

Run `npm install --save-dev`.

Then run `npm run build` followed by `npm run start` for the "default" runtime.
For debugging purposes use `npm run dev` in combination with `tsc --watch`.

Alternative use the Dockerfile to build and run a Node container by running `bash run-container.sh` in the current directory.
