# Drawing Tool

## How to use

Run `npm install` (at least if typescript is not installed yet).  
Then just it with an IDE integrated Webserver or drag the `index.html` into the browser of your choice (but keep the file structure of the project in tact ðŸ˜‰)

I used [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE with the [Live Server Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

This way you'll be able to run it by right-clicking the `index.html` and choosing `Open with Live Server` in the popup-menu.
